 *
 * Packed formats are those where each sample contains each audio channel, one
 * packed after the other.  Planar formats use separate runs of samples for each
 * channel (each channel has its own sample plane).  For the most part,
 * playd deals in the former, resampling instances of the latter.
 *
 * REMEMBER: changes here will require changes in lookup tables in both
 * sample_formats.cpp and audio_sink.cpp.
