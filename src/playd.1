.\"=============
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.\"=============
.Nm
is a simple audio player,
intended to be driven by other software via a line-based TCP protocol.
Its feature set is described in
.Sx COMMANDS .
.Pp
.Nm
has a simple feature list: it can
load one audio file (given its path),
play that file,
pause playback of that file,
seek and eject that file,
and periodically emit the current position in that file.
.\"------------
.Ss Invocation
.\"------------
If no arguments are given,
.Nm
lists all possible valid values for the
.Ar device
argument.
Otherwise, it is launched as a daemon, with the arguments meaning:
.Bl -tag -width "address" -offset indent
.\"-
.It Ar device
The ID of the device onto which
.Nm
will output audio.  The
.Ar device
.Em must
be on the list given when
.Nm
is executed with zero arguments.
.\"-
.It Ar address
The IP address to which
.Nm
will bind when listening for client connections;
the default is 127.0.0.1 (only local connections).
To accept all connections, use 0.0.0.0.
.\"-
.It Ar port
The TCP port on which
.Nm
will listen for client connections; the default is 1350.
.El
.\"----------
.Ss Protocol
.\"----------
.Nm
speaks a simple, textual protocol inspired by the POSIX shell:
.Bl -dash -offset indent -compact
.It
Requests and responses consist of one or more whitespace-delimited
.Em words ,
followed by a line-feed.
.It
The first word, the
.Em tag ,
uniquely identifies the request being sent
or answered.
Examples of good tags include UUIDs,
or hashes of the command send time and
originating host.
Broadcasts from the server have the tag '!'.
.It
The next word, the
.Em command word ,
denotes the specific request
(if in
.Em lowercase ) ,
or response
(if in
.Em CAPITALS ) :
.Nm
is case-sensitive.
.It
Words may contain backslashes, which
.Em escape
the next character, reproducing it verbatim.
This can be used to permit whitespace, which would otherwise end the word.
.It
In addition, words may be
.Em quoted
in either
.Em double quotes ,
in which backslash escaping is respected, or
.Em single quotes ,
in which it is ignored.
.El
.\"-----------------------------
.Ss Controlling from a terminal
.\"-----------------------------
Since
.Nm
only speaks TCP/IP (by design),
it can be hard to speak with it from a terminal on the local machine.
Programs such as
.Xr nc 1
or
.Xr socat 1
may bridge this gap in functionality.
.\"
.\"==========
.Sh COMMANDS
.\"==========
The sets of valid requests to, and responses from, a
.Nm
session are:
.\"
.\"----------
.Ss Requests
.\"----------
.Bl -tag -width "load path" -offset indent
.It eject
Unloads the current file, stopping any playback.
.It fload Ar path
Loads the file at
.Ar path ,
which must be absolute.
.It play
Starts, or resumes, playback of the current file.
.It pos Ar micros
Seeks to
.Ar micros
microseconds past the start of the file.
Seeking past a file's end is equivalent to seeking to the end directly.
.It stop
Stops playback of the current file, keeping the current position.
.It end
Makes
.Nm
behave as if the current file has just ended.
.\"
.It dump
Asks
.Nm
to emit all current state to this client as responses.
.El
.\"
.\"-----------
.Ss Responses
.\"-----------
.Bl -tag -width "FLOAD path " -offset indent
.It OHAI Ar id Ar protocol Ar server
Sent upon connection.
.Ar id
is the ID assigned to the connected client.
.Ar protocol
is the name and version of the Bifrost protocol being used.
.Ar server
identifies the playd server and version number.
.\"
.It IAMA Ar role
Describes the Bifrost role
.Nm
implements.  This identifies the features
.Nm
provides to external clients.
.\"
.It ACK OK Ar details
.Nm
just finished processing a request,
identified by the tag of this response.
Further details are provided in
.Ar details .
.\"
.It ACK FAIL Ar details
.Nm
failed to execute a request,
identified by the tag of this response.
Further details are provided in
.Ar details .
.\"
.It ACK WHAT Ar details
.Nm
did not understand a request,
identified by the tag of this response.
Further details are provided in
.Ar details .
.\"
.It DUMP
.Nm
has finished responding to a dump command.
.\"
.It END
The loaded file has reached its physical end.
.\"
.It EJECT
There is no currently loaded file.
.\"
.It FLOAD Ar path
The file at
.Ar path
is loaded.
.\"
.It PLAY
The currently loaded file is now playing.
.\"
.It STOP
The currently loaded file is now stopped.
.\"
.It POS Ar pos
Periodic announcement of the current file position in microseconds,
.Ar pos .
.El

.\"==========
.Sh EXAMPLES
.\"==========
Without arguments,
.Dl % playd
will produce a list of available devices:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
0: HDA ATI SB: ALC892 Analog (hw:0,0)
1: HDA ATI SB: ALC892 Digital (hw:0,1)
2: HDA ATI SB: ALC892 Alt Analog (hw:0,2)
3: HDA NVidia: ID 42 Digital (hw:1,3)
4: Plantronics GameCom 780: USB Audio (hw:2,0)
5: sysdefault
6: front
7: surround40
8: default
9: dmix
.Ed
.Pp
Say we want to output on the GameCon.
The command
.Dl % playd 4
will start
.Nm
on its default address (localhost) and port, outputting on device ID 4.
.Pp
To change the address and port, we specify them as arguments:
.Dl % playd 4 127.0.0.1 1350
.Pp
To connect to
.Nm
from the terminal, we can use
.Xr nc 1 :
.Dl % nc 127.0.0.1 1350
.Pp
A session with
.Nm
may look like the following:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
-> ! OHAI 1 'bifrost-0.3.0' 'playd-0.3.0'
-> ! IAMA player/file
-> ! POS 0
-> ! EJECT
<- 1 fload '/usr/home/foo/awesome-mix.mp3'
-> ! FLOAD '/usr/home/foo/awesome-mix.mp3'
-> ! STOP
-> 1 ACK OK success
<- 2 play
-> ! PLAY
-> 2 ACK OK success
(file plays to end)
-> ! END
-> ! STOP
-> ! POS 0
-> 3 eject
<- ! EJECT
<- 3 ACK OK success

.Sh BUGS
.\"======
Behaviour when escaping multi-byte UTF-8 characters with
.Dq \e
is undefined; this is intentional, for reasons of code simplicity.
