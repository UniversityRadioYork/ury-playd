# URY playd

URY playd (or just `playd`; short for _player daemon_) is a C++ audio
player developed by [University Radio York].  It's designed to be
minimal, hackable, and composable into bigger systems (such as our
ongoing BAPS3 project to build a new radio playout system).


## Usage

`playd DEVICE-ID [ADDRESS] [PORT]`

* Invoking `playd` with no arguments lists the various device IDs
  available to it.
* Full protocol information is available on the GitHub wiki.
* On POSIX systems, see the enclosed man page.

For command usage, see `README.commands.md`.

### Sending commands manually

To connect directly to `playd` and issue commands to it, you can use
[netcat]:

    # If you specified [ADDRESS] or [PORT], replace localhost and 1350 respectively.
    $ nc localhost 1350

On Windows, using [PuTTY] in _raw mode_ (__not__ Telnet mode) with
_Implicit CR in every LF_ switched on in the _Terminal_ options should
work.

__Do _not_ use a Telnet client (or PuTTY in telnet mode)!__  `playd` will
do weird things in the presence of Telnet-isms.


## Features

* Plays MP3s, Ogg Vorbis, FLACs and WAV files;
* Seek;
* Frequently announces the current position;
* TCP/IP interface with text protocol;
* Deliberately not much else.


## Philosophy

`playd` is developed using the following guidelines:

* Do one thing and do it well;
* Be hackable;
* Favour simplicity over performance;
* Favour simplicity over features;
* Let other programs handle the shinies.


## Compilation

### Requirements

* [libuv] 0.10+
* [SDL2] 2.0.3
* A C++11 compiler (recent versions of [clang], [gcc], and Visual Studio
  work)

The following dependencies are used for file format support, and you'll need at
least one of them:

* [libmpg123] 1.20.1+, for MP3 support;
* [libflac++] 1.3.0+, for FLAC support;
* [libsndfile] 1.0.25+, for Ogg Vorbis, WAV, and FLAC support (if libflac++ isn't available).

Certain operating systems may need additional dependencies; see the OS-specific
build instructions below.

### POSIX (GNU/Linux, BSD, OS X)

`playd` comes `config.sh`, a Bourne shell script that will generate a
GNU-compatible Makefile that can be used both to make and install.

To use the Makefile, you'll need [GNU Make] and `pkg-config` (or equivalent),
and pkg-config packages for SDL2, libuv, and any needed decoder libraries.
We've tested building playd on Gentoo, FreeBSD 10, and OS X, but other
POSIX-style operating systems should work.

Using the Makefile is straightforward:

* Ensure you have the dependencies above;
* Run `config.sh` (optionally, read it first to see if any variables need to be
  overriden for your environment);
* Optionally read the generated `Makefile`, to make sure it's ok;
* Run `make` (or whatever GNU Make is called on your OS; in FreeBSD, for
  example, it'd be `gmake`), and, optionally, `sudo make install`.
  The latter will globally install playd and its man page.

#### OS X

All dependencies are available in [homebrew] - it is highly recommended that
you use it!

#### FreeBSD (10+)

FreeBSD 10 and above come with `clang` 3.3 as standard, which should be able to
compile `playd`.  `gcc` is available through the FreeBSD Ports Collection
and package repositories.

You will need `gmake`, as `Makefile` is incompatible with BSD make.  Sorry!

All of `playd`'s dependencies are available through both the FreeBSD Ports
Collection and standard package repository.  To install them as packages:

    root@freebsd:/ # pkg install gmake libmpg123 libsndfile libflac libuv sdl2 pkgconf

Then, run `gmake` (__not__ `make`), and, optionally, `gmake install` to install
`playd` (as root):

    user@freebsd:~/ % gmake
    root@freebsd:~/ # gmake install

### Windows

#### Visual Studio

_For more information, see `README.VisualStudio.md`._

playd **can** be built with Visual Studio (tested with 2013 Premium), but
you will need to source and configure the dependencies manually.  A Visual
Studio project is provided, but will need tweaking for your environment.

#### MinGW

We haven't managed ourselves, but assuming you can build all the dependencies,
(libsox is the difficult one), it should work fine.
