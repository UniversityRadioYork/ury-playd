<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p><strong>playd</strong> is a tiny cross-platform audio player developed by
<a href="http://ury.org.uk">University Radio York</a>.  It uses <a href="https://isocpp.org">C++14</a> and libraries like
<a href="http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile">libsndfile</a>, <a href="https://mpg123.org">libmpg123</a>, <a href="https://www.libsdl.org">SDL2</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/libuv/libuv">libuv</a> to decode audio, play it
to any output device, and take commands via a simple, line-based
TCP protocol.</p>

<p>The latest release at time of writing is <a href="https://github.com/UniversityRadioYork/ury-playd/releases/tag/v0.3.0">v0.3.0</a> <em>Archway</em>; the
documentation hosted here refers to it.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p><strong>playd</strong> doesn&#39;t have many features, as it&#39;s intended to be a minimal
player core for use in bigger things.  Here are some features it
<em>does</em> have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Plays any file format supported by libsox;</li>
<li>Selectable output device at launch-time;</li>
<li>Play/Stop/Seek/Eject/Load commands;</li>
<li>Text-based TCP/IP interface;</li>
<li>Cross-platform: we&#39;ve built it on Windows, FreeBSD, OS X, and
some GNU/Linux distributions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Launching <strong>playd</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>$ playd
usage: playd ID [HOST] [PORT]
where ID is one of the following numbers:
        0: Speakers (Sound Blaster Z)
        1: SPDIF-Out (Sound Blaster Z)
        2: Realtek Digital Output(Optical) (Realtek High Definition Audio)
        3: Realtek Digital Output (Realtek High Definition Audio)
        4: ASUS VE278-4 (NVIDIA High Definition Audio)
default HOST: 0.0.0.0
default PORT: 1350
$ playd 0
</code></pre>

<p>Connecting to <strong>playd</strong> through a TCP/IP client (commands in lowercase are
sent by the client, commands in capitals from the server):</p>
